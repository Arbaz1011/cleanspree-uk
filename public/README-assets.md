# Where to put assets

## Logo
Put your logo file here with one of these names:
- **logo.png**
- **logo.svg**
- **logo.webp**

The site will pick it up automatically (header and footer).  
Path: `public/logo.png` (same folder as this file).

## Service images
Service images are currently set to stock photos in code. To use your own, edit `src/lib/constants.ts` (SERVICE_IMAGES) or add files to `public/images/services/` and use the API (see docs).
